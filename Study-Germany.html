                            <p>Germany has recently brought in a law to double the work time for international students,
                                of which Indians form the biggest bloc. There are around 43,000 Indian students at
                                German universities, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office.</p>

                                    its industries</li>
                                <li>Germany doubled the time international students are allowed to work to 20 hours a

                            </ul>


                            <p>Germany is facing an acute labour crisis and eyeing Indian students to fill the critical
                                gaps that could otherwise cripple its industries. Germany has recently brought in a law
                                to double the work time for international students, of which Indians form the biggest
                                bloc.</p>

                            <p>There are around 43,000 Indian students at German universities, according to Germany's
                                Federal Statistical Office. Germany saw a 26% increase in Indian students in the country
                                for the winter semester of 2022-23.</p>

                            <p>A German permanent residence permit, sometimes called a settlement permit, can be issued
                                to non-EU citizens who have lived in Germany for five years or more.</p>

                            <p>Germany is a Western European country with a landscape of forests, rivers, mountain
                                ranges, and North Sea beaches. It has over 2 millennia of history. Berlin, its capital,
                                is home to art and nightlife scenes, the Brandenburg Gate, and many sites relating to
                                WWII. Munich is known for its Oktoberfest and beer halls, including the 16th-century
                                Hofbräuhaus. Frankfurt, with its skyscrapers, houses the European Central Bank.</p>

                                costs of medical care and medicines do not have to be paid privately. A student health
                                insurance will cost around 96 euros per month or 1,152 (1,145 USD) euros per year. </p>

                            <p>You will have to move around a lot as a student in Germany to attend classes, go grocery
                                shopping, meet friends, etc. Germany has many options for transportation like buses,
                                trains, taxis, rental cars, bicycles, etc. Taxis and rental cars are expensive, they
                                charge 1.5 to 3 euros per kilometer. International students choose the less expensive
                                options including bicycles, buses, and trains. Buses and trains fall under public
                                transport and are called öffentlicher Personennahverkehr (ÖPNV). Depending on the area
                                and transportation options, you should budget 116 euros each month (1,392 euros or 1,384
                                USD a year). Tickets can be purchased online or through an app. Several universities
                                provide students with a semester ticket that allows them to use public transport at a
                                reduced rate. They usually charge between 100 and 350 euros per semester.</p>

                                    target="_blank">countries who need a student visa to study in Germany</a>, then you
                                will be required to provide proof of financial means (Finanzierungsnachweis) when you
                                apply for your visa. As of 2023, an international student needs €11,904 per year to
                                cover their expenses during their time in Germany.</p>
                            <p>The best way to provide proof of financial resources at the German Embassy is through
                                a <a href="https://www.studying-in-germany.org/germany-blocked-account-foreign-students/"
                                    target="_blank">blocked account</a>. You can also prove your finances through your
                                parents’ financial details, a guarantee from a resident in Germany, a bank guarantee, or
                                a scholarship.</p>

                            <h4 class="pt-4"><b>Health Insurance</b></h4>
                            <p>Health insurance is mandatory if you want to study in Germany. If you are a resident of
                                one of the EU/EEA member states or some other country with which Germany has a social
                                insurance agreement, then you will likely be able to use your health insurance from back
                                home. This is usually done by obtaining a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, if your insurance is not recognized in Germany, you’ll need to obtain
                                German health insurance to provide as <a

                                public (around €120 per month) or private (if you’re over 30) health insurance
                                providers.</p>

                            <p>If you’re planning to study in Germany for up to 90 days, you’ll generally need a
                                Schengen visa unless you’re from a country that’s exempt from this visa requirement. For
                                study periods over 90 days, a national visa is necessary, with exemptions also
                                applicable for certain countries.</p>
                            <p>If you need a student visa for Germany, you’ll need to apply at the German embassy or
                                consulate in your country. This process includes collecting the necessary documents,
                                attending an interview at the embassy, and waiting for their decision. Keep in mind that
                                the processing time for a student visa can take up to 25 days, depending on the
                                embassy’s location and workload.</p>


                            <h4 class="pt-4"><b>Accommodation</b></h4>
                            <p>As an international student in Germany, you have several housing options, including halls
                                of residence, private apartments, and shared apartments (WG). Keep in mind that rent
                                will likely be your largest expense, with students spending an average of €410 monthly
                                on accommodation.</p>
                            <p>Specifically, student dorms cost about €266.83 on average, shared apartments (WGs) are
                                around €363, and private apartments are typically €820, though prices can greatly differ
                                depending on the location and facilities.</p>
                            <p>Remember that you have to register your address at the local registration office within
                                two weeks of arriving in Germany.</p>

                            <h4 class="pt-4"><b>University Enrollment</b></h4>
                            <p>Once you’re accepted into a German university, the next step is to enroll by providing
                                certain documents to the Student Affairs Office and registering for your courses. This
                                process will give you a matriculation number and a university account, which you’ll use
                                for various university services.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, you’ll receive a student ID card. This card is not just for identification;
                                it also works as a semester transport ticket, a library card, a payment card for the
                                cafeteria, and a pass for various cultural events.</p>

                                demands. DAAD suggests joint action by government, universities and businesses in
                                developing a new international recruitment and retention strategy. The agency aims to
                                double the number of graduates retained in Germany to approximately 50,000 per year by

                                German Centre for Higher Education Research and Science Studies (DZHW), the number of
                                international students in Germany has risen significantly over the past 10 years. The
                                winter semester of 2020/21 saw a record-breaking 324,729 international students studying
                                in Germany. This means international students account for 11% of all students in the
                                country. This figure represents a significant increase of 75.5% since the winter
                                semester of 2010/11 when there were 184,960 international students.</p>

                            <P>Out of all international students, 31.4% came from Asia and the Pacific region, making it
                                the largest group of international students in Germany. This was followed by North
                                Africa and the Middle East with over 63,000 students, Western Europe with over 54,000
                                students, and Central and Southeastern Europe with over 35,000 students. China was the
                                country with the highest number of international students in Germany in 2020/21,
                                accounting for 12.4% of the total student population. India followed closely behind with
                                nearly 15% increase in student population compared to the previous year.</P> -->
