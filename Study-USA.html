                                European thought, politics, and art for over 1,000 years. This history has shaped a
                                culture that combines predominantly Christian values with literature, art, philosophy,
                                logic, reason, and, of course, a love of beer and sausages.</p>
                            <p>The average living expense in Germany is 867 euros per month, which equates to 10,404
                                euros per year.</p>

                            <p><b>Food in Germany can cost 154 euros per month or 1,848 euros (1,838 USD) per year. You

                                students. In the event of an accident or illness, health insurance makes sure that the
                                costs of medical care and medicines do not have to be paid privately. A student health
                                insurance will cost around 96 euros per month or 1,152 (1,145 USD) euros per year. </p>

                                trains, taxis, rental cars, bicycles, etc. Taxis and rental cars are expensive, they
                                charge 1.5 to 3 euros per kilometer. International students choose the less expensive
                                options including bicycles, buses, and trains. Buses and trains fall under public
                                transport and are called öffentlicher Personennahverkehr (ÖPNV). Depending on the area
                                and transportation options, you should budget 116 euros each month (1,392 euros or 1,384
                                USD a year). Tickets can be purchased online or through an app. Several universities
                                provide students with a semester ticket that allows them to use public transport at a
                                reduced rate. They usually charge between 100 and 350 euros per semester.</p>

                                apply for your visa. As of 2023, an international student needs €11,208 per year to

                                one of the EU/EEA member states or some other country with which Germany has a social
                                insurance agreement, then you will likely be able to use your health insurance from back

                                study periods over 90 days, a national visa is necessary, with exemptions also
                                applicable for certain countries.</p>
                            <p>If you need a student visa for Germany, you’ll need to apply at the German embassy or
                                consulate in your country. This process includes collecting the necessary documents,
                                attending an interview at the embassy, and waiting for their decision. Keep in mind that
                                the processing time for a student visa can take up to 25 days, depending on the
                                embassy’s location and workload.</p>

                                on accommodation.</p>
                            <p>Specifically, student dorms cost about €266.83 on average, shared apartments (WGs) are
                                around €363, and private apartments are typically €820, though prices can greatly differ
                                depending on the location and facilities.</p>
                            <p>Remember that you have to register your address at the local registration office within
                                two weeks of arriving in Germany.</p>

                            <h4 class="pt-4"><b>University Enrollment</b></h4>
                            <p>Once you’re accepted into a German university, the next step is to enroll by providing
                                certain documents to the Student Affairs Office and registering for your courses. This
                                process will give you a matriculation number and a university account, which you’ll use
                                for various university services.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, you’ll receive a student ID card. This card is not just for identification;
                                it also works as a semester transport ticket, a library card, a payment card for the
                                cafeteria, and a pass for various cultural events.</p>

                            <p>International students in Germany can bring family members, including spouses and
                                children, through the German Family Reunion Visa</p>

                                    target="_blank"> paper </a>from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)
                                emphasizes the significance of international education in addressing labor market
                                demands. DAAD suggests joint action by government, universities and businesses in
                                developing a new international recruitment and retention strategy. The agency aims to
                                double the number of graduates retained in Germany to approximately 50,000 per year by
                                2030.</p>

                            <p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.wissenschaft-weltoffen.de/en/"
                                    target="_blank">report</a> by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the
                                German Centre for Higher Education Research and Science Studies (DZHW), the number of
                                international students in Germany has risen significantly over the past 10 years. The
                                winter semester of 2020/21 saw a record-breaking 324,729 international students studying
                                in Germany. This means international students account for 11% of all students in the
                                country. This figure represents a significant increase of 75.5% since the winter
                                semester of 2010/11 when there were 184,960 international students.</p>

                            <P>Out of all international students, 31.4% came from Asia and the Pacific region, making it
                                the largest group of international students in Germany. This was followed by North
                                Africa and the Middle East with over 63,000 students, Western Europe with over 54,000
                                students, and Central and Southeastern Europe with over 35,000 students. China was the
                                country with the highest number of international students in Germany in 2020/21,
                                accounting for 12.4% of the total student population. India followed closely behind with
                                nearly 15% increase in student population compared to the previous year.</P>
