                            <p>The climate of the United States varies due to changes in latitude, and a range of
                                geographic features, including mountains and deserts. Generally, on the mainland, the
                                climate of the U.S. becomes warmer the further south one travels, and drier the further
                                west, until one reaches the West Coast. </p>

                            <p>As an international student or foreign national, you will generally need a visa to enter
                                the USA for any length of time. The visa category for most international students is F1,
                                and we have more information on that and other categories below. International students
                                visas are issued and regulated by USCIS, the United States Citizenship and Immigration
                                Service, and the whole process of obtaining a visa to either study in the USA or to work
                                can be quite daunting. The International Student Visa and Immigration Center has been
                                established to provide our visitors with the right information concerning their student
                                or work visa.</p>

                                specifically for workers in specialty occupations that require a higher level of
                                education or technical experience such as science, medicine, engineering and <a

                                the country and continue gaining experience in a given field. Generally this visa is
                                granted for a period of three years and can be extended for an additional three years
                                for special circumstances. Unlike other visa types where you can apply for yourself, the
                                H-1B visa requires your employer to apply on your behalf.</p>
